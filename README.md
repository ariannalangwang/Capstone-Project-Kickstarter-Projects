# Kickstarter Project

A data science project I did analyzing Kickstarter projects using machine learning and natural language processing algorithms. 

In this repository, you will find a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing my programming code and a written report of my analyses.

This project includes the following steps:

Data Cleaning and data wrangling

Exploratory data analyses

Data visualization

Making predictions via machine learning models

Using NLP (natural language processing) to make classifications and predictions
